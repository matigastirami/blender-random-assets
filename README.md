# blender-random-assets
Every 3D model I'do in my learning path will be placed here. They are being done based on an Udemy course of Blender. In the assets you will find modeling, sculpting, baking,
and texturing, both for baked textures and PBR/Handpainted textures. 

This readme file will be updated as soon as I finish the model, with links to Sketchfab.
